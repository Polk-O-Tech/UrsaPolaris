			`	As you land, James invites you to meet at the recently opened "Nourish Bistro", supposedly a local restaurant`
			`	While the "Nourish Bistro" turns out to be little more than a hole in the (asteroid) wall bar, the sandwiches they serve are nonetheless delicious. James regales you with tales from his long ago adventures, before returning to more current affairs.`

			`	The Heliarchs are indeed quite enthuasisatic about further undermining the isolation imposed by the Quarg. But their strong desire to ensure equal opportunity among the Arach, Saryd and Kimek drags out negotiations significantly.`
            `   Eventually you come to an agreement where shipments will rotate between the species. While this will no doubt complicate your supply lines, it's the best you're going to get. `
