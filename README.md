An Endless Sky post-main-arc universal outfitter station story

This plugin contains missions for your pilot to create a centrally located outfitter space station that stocks outfits from across the galaxy, and unlock all outfits made available through the Free Worlds plot, regardless of your arc choices (which will almost always preclude you from at least one). it additionally offers a few new end-game outfits with interesting balance points (that are quite effective). In all seriousness, though - balance was my primary focus - this is not a cheat mod, and an outfitter with all the outfits should cost what it does (or possibly more. this may change in the near future, as economic balances are applied within E.S.)

Start by finding James where you left him off during the tutorial.


# What is this Repo

Me (a clueless firsttime ES modder) poking a bear.

No but really, I intended to update this plugin because I love it, but after looking over the code and trying to understand it (with help from the wonderful https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki), I'm simply amazed at the ability of ES to be backwards compatible. I made miniscule changes, mostly to make the code prettier, but everything should just work. 

- [x] look over outfits to ensure none got lost (+small code updates i guess)
- [ ] coalition outfits
- [ ] Redo WeiMiExpressway/end of UP missions
- [ ] Salvage Missions for non-purchasable aliens
- [ ] Patch for Midnight
- [ ] other patches?
